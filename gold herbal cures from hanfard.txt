üëâüèæA man that does not get strong erection every morning after waking up is having a weak erection
üëâüèΩ A man with a weak erection can penetrate his partner but he wouldn't really enjoy the sex because his manhood won't be strong and thick like it's supposed to be. 
* QUICK EJACULATION *
This is when a man ejaculates lesser than the time he wishes to cum, or he ejaculates less than the normal time a man should last, and that is at least 15 to 20mins from your first round, and more on your second and other rounds.
Some men even cums by mere kissing or romancing their woman. Other's ejaculates immediately they put it inside and some it's before they put it inside.

SIMPLE HOME REMEDY TO TREAT PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT.
The prostate is a gland that produces some of the fluid that carries sperm during ejaculation. The prostate gland surrounds the urethra, the tube through which urine passes out of the body. The prostate is a walnut-sized gland located between the bladder and the penis. The prostate is just in front of the rectum. The urethra runs through the center of the prostate, from the bladder to the penis, letting urine flow out of the body. The prostate secretes fluid that nourishes and protects sperm.
An enlarged prostate means the gland has grown bigger. Prostate enlargement happens to almost all men as they get older. An enlarged prostate is often called Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH).
CAUSES:
The actual cause of prostate enlargement is unknown. Factors linked to aging and changes in the cells of the testicles may have a role in the growth of the gland, as well as testosterone levels. Men who have had their testicles removed at a young age (for example, as a result of testicular cancer) do not develop BPH.
Also, if the testicles are removed after a man develops BPH, the prostate begins to shrink in size. However, this is not a standard treatment for an enlarged prostate.
SYMPTOMS OF PROSTATE PROBLEMS:
-  Frequent urge to urinate. Need to get up many times during the night to urinate.
-  Blood in urine or semen.
-  Pain or burning urination.
-  Painful ejaculation.
-  Frequent pain or stiffness in lower back, hips, pelvic or rectal area, or upper thighs.
-  Dribbling of urine.
EARLY WARNING SIGNS OF PROSTATE CANCER:
-  Burning or pain during urination.
-  Difficulty urinating, or trouble starting and stopping while urinating.
-  More frequent urges to urinate at night.
-  Loss of bladder control.
-  Decreased flow or velocity of urine stream.
-  Blood in urine (hematuria)
-  Blood in semen.
WHAT WILL SHRINK AN ENLARGED 
PROSTATE NATURALLY?

HEALING POWER OF WATERLEAF
*Waterleaf, (Talinum triangular), is one of those underrated and undervalued plants in Nigeria. Some even regard water leaf as a nuisance, a stubborn weed that grows all year, though it flourished more during the rainy season.
*Water leaf is also a good remedy for insomnia (sleeping disorder).
*Water leaf contains more proteins than cashew nuts, more pectin (a food fiber that helps digestion) than apples, and also have high level of vitamin B, essential amino acids, omega3-fatty acids, resins, iron, calcium, copper, lead, manganese and zinc. It is also a rich vitamin C, A, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, alpha and beta tocopherols.
*The pounded water leaf is applied to soothe inflammations. An infusion of the leaves is taken as a diuretic. For prostate enlargement, the roots are boiled. The dosage is half a glass twice daily. Water leaf is good and safe for pregnant women and growing children, as it boosts their blood levels. Eating water leaf regularly as soup helps to regulate hypertension and diabetes.
*While water leaf is very beneficial when it is taken as vegetable, dried herbs and infusion. However , juicing is the way to go if you want the best out of water leaf. 
What is juicing? Juicing is a process whereby you extract vitamins, minerals and liquids from fruits and vegetables.
*To make water leaf juice, simply chop water leaf, both stem and leaves, into pieces, in the same way as you do if you want to cook it. Then put two or three handfuls in the blender and add one liter of water. Blend in same way as you blend your tomato or fruit. Sieve out the chaff and you will be left with a dark green liquid, packed with vitamins and minerals. Ensure you drink and finish the whole drink within 10 minutes. This is one big mistake many people make. They blend fruits and vegetables and then store then in the freezer for days. If you do that, you have already lost 60% of the active ingredients in the juice. So if you want to get a 100% benefit from your waterleaf juice, drink it within 10 minutes.
*Do you feel tired and weak every time on bed? Are you battling with diabetes, hypertension and arthritis? Are you prone to frequent bouts of malaria? Have you been diagnosed with cancer or you want to prevent it? You want a glowing and youthful skin? I strongly recommend you take waterleaf juice twice a week. A trial will convince you.
In addition, waterleaf is one of the best medicine against MEASLES in children. Pound a handful and add warm water. Strain an use as enema (pump) every morning for about a week.

Surprised!, Just Onion Juice can perform this wonder to our prostate health? what are you waiting for?
ONION REMEDY FOR A HEALTHY PROSTATE AT ALL AGES.
Here is a simple remedy available to everyone to never suffer from prostate diseases. Those who already suffer from it can also try it. It works very well.
Know first that in all men, from 25 years the prostate accumulates toxins due to urine and semen which pass through the urethra. The prostate also participates in the composition of sperm by adding a secretion that is not entirely eliminated from this gland. When the residual secretions stay there, it participates in its progressive intoxication. This will lead to inflammation, swelling of the gland and its inability to play its role, thus affecting sex life (sexual weakness, premature ejaculation, etc.).
To keep this gland in good condition until your old age, it is important to detoxify it periodically. Conventional medicine does not yet offer us anything concrete and reliable to protect our prostate from premature old age. But among the panoply of solutions offered by herbal medicine, we have drawn a simple, inexpensive and less restrictive recipe: onion juice.
Recipe:
1- Take 8 large onions or a dozen if they are medium in size.
2- Remove the peels (dry skin of the onions) then clean properly.
3- Cut them roughly then pound them in a clean mortar. You can have them crushed on traditional furniture. Do not put them in a blender to avoid adding water.
4- Collect the pure onion juice using a scarf or a clean cloth.
5- Drink a 33cl glass of this juice.
6- Repeat the operation three weeks later, then a third time after another three weeks. That's all. You have just rid your prostate of all kinds of toxins. The gland regains its youthful state. Repeat this series of operations every 10 years.
Even at 75 years old, without a problem with your blood circulation, you will still be firm as a young person.

HOME HERBAL REMEDY FOR BREAST CANCER
Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control. Breast cancer cells usually form a tumor that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women, but men can get breast cancer, too.
It‚Äôs important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer (malignant). Non-cancerous breast tumors are abnormal growths, but they do not spread outside of the breast. They are not life threatening, but some types of benign breast lumps can increase a woman's risk of getting breast cancer. Any breast lump or change needs to be checked by a health care professional to determine if it is benign or malignant (cancer) and if it might affect your future cancer risk. 
WHERE DOES BREAST CANCER STARTS
Breast cancers can start from different parts of the breast. Most breast cancers begin in the ducts that carry milk to the nipple (ductal cancers). Some start in the glands that make breast milk (lobular cancers) There are also other types of breast cancer that are less common like phyllodes tumor and angiosarcoma
A small number of cancers start in other tissues in the breast. These cancers are called sarcomas and lymphomas and are not really thought of as breast cancers.
Although many types of breast cancer can cause a lump in the breast, not all do. Many breast cancers are also found on screening mammograms, which can detect cancers at an earlier stage, often before they can be felt, and before symptoms develop. Breast Cancer develops as a result of genetic mutations or damage to DNA. These can be associated with exposure to estrogen, inherited genetic defects, or inherited genes that can cause cancer such as BRCA1, and BRCA2 genes. When a person is healthy, their immune system attacks any abnormal DNA or growths.
Most breast cancer are found in women who are 50 years old or older. Some women will get breast cancer even without any other risk factors, that they know of. Having a risk factor does not means you will get the disease, and not all risk factors have the same effect.
TYPES OF BREAST CANCER
There are many different types of breast cancer and common ones include ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive carcinoma. Others, like phyllodes tumors and angiosarcoma are less common.
Once a biopsy is done, breast cancer cells are tested for proteins called estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and HER2. The tumor cells are also closely looked at in the lab to find out what grade it is. The specific proteins found and the tumor grade can help decide treatment options. A Breast lump is painless, hard, irregularly shaped and different from surrounding breast tissue might be breast cancer, skin covering the lump may look red, dimpled or pitted like the skin of an Orange. Your breast size and shape may change, or you may notice discharge from the nipple.
HOW BREAST CANCER SPREADS
Breast cancer can spread when the cancer cells get into the blood or lymph system and are carried to other parts of the body. 
The lymph system is a network of lymph (or lymphatic) vessels found throughout the body that connects lymph nodes (small bean-shaped collections of immune system cells). The clear fluid inside the lymph vessels, called lymph, contains tissue by-products and waste material, as well as immune system cells. The lymph vessels carry lymph fluid away from the breast. In the case of breast cancer, cancer cells can enter those lymph vessels and start to grow in lymph nodes. Most of the lymph vessels of the breast drain into:
-   Lymph nodes under the arm (axillary nodes)
-   Lymph nodes around the collar bone (supraclavicular [above the collar bone] and infraclavicular [below the collar bone] lymph nodes)
-   Lymph nodes inside the chest near the breast bone (internal mammary lymph nodes)
A Cancerous Lump may feel rounded, soft, and tender and can occur anywhere in the breast. In some cases, the lump can even be painful. See women also have dense, fibrous breast tissue. Feeling Lumps or changes in your breast may be more difficult if this is the case.
Fortunately, Breast Cancer is very treatable if you spot it early. Localized Cancer (meaning it hasn't spread outside your breast) can usually be treated before it spreads. Once the cancer begins to spread, treatment becomes more complicated. It can often control the disease for years.

UNCLOG THE FALLOPIAN TUBES WITH THE USE OF THE KING OF HERBS(EWE IMI ESU)
Damaged or blocked tubes can cause infertility. The tubes have an essential role in fertilization. Once released by the ovary (at the time of ovulation), the egg will nest in the pinna of the tube. It is joined by the sperm. If one of them succeeds in penetrating it, then fertilization takes place. But in order for this mechanism to work, there must be at least one functioning ovary and tube.
When these two organs are blocked, natural fertilization - and therefore pregnancy - is impossible. You should also know that if one of the tubes is not completely blocked, there is a risk of ectopic pregnancy because the egg may have difficulty circulating from the tube to the uterine cavity. The tubes are sometimes disturbed by adhesion phenomena that prevent the passage of the egg, sperm and embryo.
Here are 2 natural methods of unblocking the fallopian tubes with the use of King of Herbs (Ageratum conyzoides).
 Method 1: 
Pile the leaves of the king of herbs, dry them to finally make them into a fine powder. Take a large dollop of the powder in a large cup of lukewarm water in the morning on an empty stomach and in the evening. Duration of treatment: 3 months and go for the tubal test again.
 Method 2: 
Take the fresh leaves of the king of herbs, crush in water and obtain the solution, filter into drink and purge with it from the second day of your period until the end of your period.
 DO NOT TAKE CHEMICAL DRUGS DURING THESE DAYS.

 Good day to all our wonderful members.  
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE REMEDY
Today,we would be discussing about high blood pressure.  Recently I have heard about a lot of people who died from high blood pressure which is not a new thing is even a stale news, you just hear so so so person slumped and died, or got stroke. It is quite rampant in our days due to stress and living unhealthy life style. 
You wake up 4a.m eat gala and coke as breakfast, get home from work 9.30 p.m eat dinner 10 p.m sleep 10.45 p.m and wake 4 a.m which continues in vicious cycle.  
What is high blood pressure?  
Many adults around the world deal with hypertension also called high blood pressure.  High blood pressure, or hypertension, occurs when your blood pressure increases to unhealthy levels. Your blood pressure measurement takes into account how much blood is passing through your blood vessels and the amount of resistance the blood meets while the heart is pumping.  Narrow arteries increase resistance. The narrower your arteries are, the higher your blood pressure will be. Over the long term, increased pressure can cause health issues, including heart disease.  Hypertension typically develops over the course of several years. Usually, you don‚Äôt notice any symptoms. 
That is why we recommend that every adult should have a sphygmomanometer in order to measure your blood pressure from time to time. 
Normal blood pressure reads between 90/60 and 120/80, anything above 120/80 is regarded as high if it tends towards 140/90 quickly seek medical attention. 
Peradventure you have a reading of less than 90/60 which is regarded as low blood pressure and mostly accompanied with symptoms of 
- Dehydration, 
- Lightheadedness,
- Dizziness,
- Fainting, and sometimes shock. 
Please get medical attention on time. But even without symptoms, high blood pressure can cause damage to your blood vessels and organs, especially the brain, heart, eyes, and kidneys.  Early detection is important. Regular blood pressure readings can help you notice any changes.  
Treatment for hypertension includes both prescription medication and healthy lifestyle changes. If the condition isn‚Äôt treated, it could lead to health issues, including heart attack and stroke. 
Symptoms of severe hypertension can include:  Headaches, shortness of breath, nosebleeds, dizziness, chest pain, visual changes, blood in the urine all these symptoms require immediate medical attention. 
How ever, is good you include the following spices to your meals:  
Garlic:
This pungent seasoning can do more than just flavor your food and ruin your breath. Garlic may have the ability to lower your blood pressure by helping to increase a substance in the body known as nitric oxide, which can cause your blood vessels to relax and dilate. This lets blood flow more freely and reduces blood pressure.  
Basil: 
This is a delicious herb that goes well in a variety of foods. Yoruba call it Efirin It also might help lower your blood pressure. In a recent research, basil extract has been shown to lower blood pressure, although only briefly. The chemical eugenol, which is found in basil, may block certain substances that tighten blood vessels.   
Cinnamon: 
This may lead to a drop in blood pressure is another tasty seasoning that requires little effort to include in your daily diet, and it may bring your blood pressure numbers down. A recent research suggested that cinnamon extract lowered both sudden-onset and prolonged high blood pressure. You can include more cinnamon in your diet by sprinkling it on your breakfast cereal, oatmeal. Cinnamon also enhances the flavor of stir-fries, soups, and stews. 
Ginger: 
May help control blood pressure. In recent studies it has been shown to improve blood circulation and relax the muscles surrounding blood vessels, lowering blood pressure. Ginger is a versatile ingredient that can also be added to sweets or beverages. Chop, mince, or grate fresh ginger into stir-fries, soups and vegetable dishes, or add it to desserts or tea for a refreshing taste.  Personally I blend ginger, garlic, turmeric and onions together and add in all my stew, soups and sometimes take it as tea early morning before break fast.  
The following natural remedies can also be used as treatment for high blood pressure:  
1. For good blood pressure maintenance take bitter leaf, basil (effirin) and zobo leaf juice and make a juice of it which makes you sleep well. If you sleep well high blood pressure will disappear. 
 2. Boil garlic, ginger, basil and zobo leaf mix with a little turmeric and moringa and take as tea. 
 3. Get Bragg Apple cider vinegar with 2 cups of water, 16 cloves of garlic, 2 tablespoon of vinegar and 3 tables spoon of honey. Mix at high speed with blender. Then put in a pot at a medium heat and lt it simmer for 30 minutes, allow to cool and store in a refrigerator while you take 2 tablespoon a day.
Please always check your blood pressure because low blood pressure is not easily managed as high blood pressure.  On a final note, exercise between 30 minutes to 60 minutes every day, reduce sodium i.e. much salt intake, limit intake of Alcohol, lose excess weight, eat more of fruits, vegetables and whole grains, eliminate food that is high in saturated fats such as fries and fatty meats and eat low-fat dairy products, lean meats, fish, and nuts.  
And remember living a healthy life style is wealth.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN QUICK 
EJACULATION AND WEAK ERECTION...
Most people believes or think that quick Ejaculation And Weak erection are the same problems. Although they both work hand in hand but they are two different things entirely. 
Let me briefly differentiate them bellow:
* WEAK ERECTION *
What is weak erection? Weak erection occurs in different ways;
-  When a man loses erection while penetrating without ejaculation is weak erection, that is if it happens almost all the time
-   When a man finds it hard to get an erection for penetration or losses erection before penetration it's weak erection
-   When a man finds it hard to go for second rounds after 20 to 60mins of resting, he is having a weak erection
-   A man that does not get strong erection every morning after waking up is having a weak erection
-   A man with a weak erection can penetrate his partner but he wouldn't really enjoy the sex because his manhood won't be strong and thick like it's supposed to be. 
* QUICK EJACULATION *
This is when a man ejaculates lesser than the time he wishes to cum, or he ejaculates less than the normal time a man should last, and that is at least 15 to 20mins from your first round, and more on your second and other rounds.
Some men even cums by mere kissing or romancing their woman. Other's ejaculates immediately they put it inside and some it's before they put it inside. 
These two problems have been giving men hard time in their marriages and relationship and with the use of natural herbs, you can overcome all this problem and you wll7 be remember as a legend. 
Bellow are herbal remedies that you can do by yourself to cure once and for all any of the Two issues as it may concerns you.

ALL THE REVELATIONS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT WALL GECKOS.
Wall Geckos are spiritual animals that the Witches and Wizards usually use on errands to torment their unsuspecting victims especially at nights.
The Geckos are used for tormenting victims in various ways amongst which are:- 
-   Bad Dreams.
-   Having sex withunknownspirit while sleeping.
-   Eating in Dreams/while fast asleep.
HOW TO GET RID OF COMMON HOUSE GECKOS
Do you have tiny, unwanted, gecko guests in your home? One sign is their black/brown droppings with a white tip. An even clearer sign is if you see one crawling up your wall! Although an ally against insects and spiders, geckos can be a pest in their own right, so sometimes steps need to be taken to remind them that they're unwelcome in your home.
HOUSEHOLD SOLUTIONS
Geckos can be good for bug control, but sometimes you just need them out of your home. You can use a variety of products you may already have to get rid of them:
1)   If you have eggshells, you can place them around your home to scare off geckos.
Place some eggshells. This is a very effective and inexpensive way to scare away geckos: they see eggshells and they think ‚Äúpredator.‚Äù Leave two eggshell halves around your home, such as at outdoor entryways, or in the kitchen.[2]
Do not crush the eggshells, leave them in two halves. One two-halves pair at every entrance should be enough: the geckos just need to run into it, then they'll run away from it.
To keep the eggshells fresh, change them every 3 to 4 weeks.
2)   If you have mothballs, you can place them around to repel geckos.
Plant some mothballs. Mothballs target moths, cockroaches, ants, flies ‚Äì and geckos! A real household panacea! Leave some under the stove, refrigerator, or sink to repel geckos.
3)   If you have coffee and tobacco, you can make a gecko poison.
Make a coffee and tobacco ball. Using moist coffee grounds and some tobacco powder, form a small ball with your hands and stick it on the end of a toothpick. Put this near where the geckos are nesting or where they might easily find it, like an outdoor entryway. The geckos will consume some of this ball and die.
4)   If you have garlic cloves, you can use them to repel geckos with the odor.
Place a garlic clove. Garlic‚Äôs strong odor isn‚Äôt just repellent to some humans, it‚Äôs also repellent to geckos, too! Leave a garlic clove around an outdoor entryway to keep them from entering that way ever again.[
5)   If you have onions, cut some up to keep geckos at bay.
Cut some onion slices. Onion slices are another irritant that will drive geckos away. Cut an onion in half and leave it in a known gecko hiding place, somewhere warm and cozy that you‚Äôve seen a gecko camping out, or by an outdoor entryway.
6)   If you have cayenne pepper or Tabasco sauce, you can make a homemade pepper spray.
Pepper-spray around your home. The irritation felt by humans when sprayed by pepper-spray is not unlike that felt by geckos that encounter it. Mix some pepper and water in a spray bottle and spray the solution around your home in places like under the refrigerator, behind the couch, or on the walls ‚Äì basically, anywhere warm or anywhere you‚Äôve seen a gecko. Cayenne pepper or chili powder can be used in place of pepper. Tabasco sauce can be used in place of the home-made pepper-spray.
Warning: spraying too much may repel ‚Äò‚Äôyou‚Äô‚Äô from your home too, so be mindful of its irritating effect.
7)   Set sticky traps. Many of the insects that geckos eat are drawn to light, so, oftentimes, geckos will hang out in those areas. Placing some flypaper near light sources will not only catch geckos‚Äô pesky food source, but will likely catch the geckos themselves. Catching animals in this method is often considered extremely inhumane, as the animal will slowly dehydrate to death.[5]
A good position to place the flypaper is on the inside of the light bulb‚Äôs shade/housing.
You can also set glue boards or sticky cards near windows or other outdoor entryways.
If you find a live gecko stuck in one of your sticky traps, you can unstick it and set it free by pouring vegetable oil over the trap while slowly peeling the animal from the glue. Be sure to gently pull up on the animal, and only where the oil has worked on the glue. The gecko can injure itself while struggling with the glue, which is why glue traps are not typically recommended.
üòé   Catch a gecko, let it go. If you have a stubborn gecko that just refuses to be repelled from your home, you can try capturing him manually, as it were, by setting a box against a wall and ‚Äúencouraging‚Äù the gecko to get inside. Then you can release it back into the wild ‚Äì and set some more repellents to keep it out!
IMPORTANTLY:- GECKOS are Very Poisonous, carefully avoid it dropping into your already prepared food items as consumption of such food can leads to death!

It is normal for a man or a woman to urinate 4 to 8 times a day. A maximum of eight times a day is still considered normal. But if one starts to urinate more than 8 times a day, or if one gets up several times during the night to urinate, then there is a case of frequent urination.
But what is usually taken into account is when you are drinking too much water than needed or as a result of latent health issues and bladder dysfunction.
The causes: 
In addition to taking in excess water, taking excessive amounts of tea, coffee, and carbonated drinks, most carbonated drinks contain coffee which draws water away from the body. Drinking a lot of alcohol can make you urinate constantly

Home Remedies for Ovarian Cysts
Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs or pockets that develop within or on the surface of one or both of a woman‚Äôs ovaries.Most ovarian cysts are considered functional, meaning that they occur normally during the menstrual cycle and are not a part of a disease process.
They are usually benign and appear without any apparent reason.
Pathological cysts, on the other hand, can either be benign or cancerous.
Often people are not aware of ovarian cysts as they typically do not cause any problems. However, in some cases they can cause symptoms like ,abdominal bloating, pain during bowel movements, menstrual irregularities, pelvic pain before or during the menstrual cycle, pain during sex, pain in the lower back or thighs, pressure in the rectum or bladder, nausea, and vomiting. Certain types of ovarian cysts can also cause decreased fertility.
In many cases, ovarian cysts disappear on their own within a few months. However, if they cause discomfort, there are many natural remedies that can help relieve symptoms and shrink the size of the cysts.
Home remedies for ovarian cysts.
1. Heat
Heat is said to be quite effective in reducing muscle cramps or pain in the abdomen due to ovarian cysts.Put a heating pad or hot water bottle on your abdomen and lower pelvic area.Do this for at least 15 minutes.Follow this remedy whenever you experience pain in the abdomen for quick relief.
2. Castor Oil Pack
Castor oil packs are an age-old remedy for ovarian cysts. Castor oil clears the body of excess tissues and toxins. It also stimulates the lymphatic and circulatory systems, which helps reduce and dissolve ovarian cysts.
Fold a large flannel cloth to make it two or three layers thick. Make sure the folded cloth is large enough to cover your entire abdomen.Drizzle about two tablespoons of castor oil on the cloth. Fold the cloth in half to saturate and then unfold it.Lay down with an old towel under you and put the flannel cloth on your abdomen.Cover the castor oil cloth with plastic and then with an old towel.Place a hot water bottle over the towel and then cover yourself in a warm blanket.Leave the castor oil pack on for at least 30 minutes and then remove it.Repeat the process about three times a week for three months.
To remove oil from the skin after using the castor oil pack, you can wash the treated area with a solution of three tablespoons of baking soda mixed in one quart (four cups) of water.
Note: Do not use castor oil packs during menstruation. If you are trying to conceive then do not use this remedy after ovulation.
3. Epsom Salt Bath
An Epsom salt bath will also greatly help reduce pain and other symptoms associated with ovarian cysts. The high magnesium sulfate content in Epsom salt works as a muscle relaxant that in turn eases pain.
Add one cup of Epsom salt to your bath tub filled with warm water.Add five to 10 drops of essential oils like lavender, rose or jasmine.Stir for a few minutes so that the salt dissolves.Soak your lower body in this water for 20 to 30 minutes.Follow this remedy once daily.
4. Apple Cider Vinegar
Apple cider vinegar can help shrink and dissolve ovarian cysts caused by potassium deficiency. It is high in potassium and recommended by many health experts.
Add one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to a glass of warm water.Mix in one tablespoon of black strap molasses.Drink one or two glasses of this solution daily.Follow this remedy until the cysts disappear completely.
This remedy will also help with the symptoms of excessive menstrual bleeding as well as bloating and cramping throughout periods.
5.Beetroot
Beetroot contains a compound known as betacyanin that boosts the liver‚Äôs ability to clear toxins out of your system. Plus, the alkaline nature of beetroot helps balance the acidity in your body. This in turn reduces the severity of many symptoms of ovarian cysts.
Mix one-half cup of freshly extracted beetroot juice with one tablespoon each of aloe vera gel and blackstrap molasses.Drink this once daily before eating your breakfast.Follow this remedy daily until your symptoms have reduced.
6. Ginger
Ginger is a strong anti-inflammatory herb that reduces inflammation and relieves pain. Also, ginger increases heat in the body and induces menstruation.
Blend a two-inch piece of ginger, half a glass of apple juice and three-fourths of a pineapple in a juicer. Drink this juice once daily until the cysts are gone.
Also, you can drink two to three cups of ginger tea daily.

Home Remedies To Stop Bad Breath 
We‚Äôve all experienced it: The uncomfortable feeling that our breath isn‚Äôt as fresh as it should be. Millions of Naria are spent by Nigerians each year on mouthwash, mints, etc. to protect against offending workmates, friends, and family with our less-than-sweet breath.
But keeping your breath fresh doesn‚Äôt always require a trip to the personal care aisle of your local store. The remedy may be closer at hand, right in your very own cupboards.
Here are six simple at-home bad breath remedies to try.
Try one of these bad breath remedies:
1. Salt water rinse
A natural way to freshen your breath instantly is to use salt water to rinse your mouth. Simply add some salt to a glass of warm water, mix it well, swish the solution around your mouth and teeth for 30 seconds and repeat. Bad odor gone!
2. Cloves
Cloves can also help freshen your breath instantly and make it kiss-ably sweet. Another advantage with cloves is that they help fight bad bacteria in your mouth that can cause cavities. So, simply suck on a few cloves a few times a day. (But, don‚Äôt use clove oil or powdered cloves ‚Äì they are too strong and can cause burns.)
3. Apple cider vinegar
If you want to get rid of the offensive mouth odors caused by eating onions and garlic, it‚Äôs easily done by using some apple cider vinegar. Add some to a glass of water and swish lightly around your mouth. This natural mouthwash will neutralize odor and freshen your breath instantly.
4. Eat your fruits and veggies
Another natural and easy way to freshen your breath is to simply have a crunchy snack, such as an apple, celery, or carrot. These fruits and vegetables act as natural toothbrushes and help to remove the odor causing bacteria stuck on your teeth. Also, they stimulate saliva production, which also helps fight bad breath.
5. Make your own alcohol-free mouthwash
Most over-the-counter mouthwashes contain alcohol, which dries out your mouth, inviting bacteria to move in.
 Here is an easy recipe you can try for making your own mouthwash with ingredients you probably already have in your kitchen.
6. Tea tree oil
Tea tree oil helps fight against odor-causing bacteria and microbes in your mouth. You can easily add it to your oral hygiene routine by adding a few drops of it to your toothpaste or simply brushing your teeth with the oil alone.
Your best bad breath defense is a good offense
Of course, one of the best ways to guard against the buildup of odor-causing bacteria is having a good dental routine. A bad-breath-blasting routine should include:
Brushing after every meal and flossing twice a day
Regular dental checkups and cleanings
Replacing your toothbrush every three months
Periodically brushing the tongue to remove bacteria
Cleaning dentures or dental appliances thoroughly at least once a day
If unpleasant breath persists after trying one of the above homemade bad breath remedies, then it is very important to make an appointment to see your dentist. Your dental team can find out if periodontal disease is the culprit behind your offensive breath and provide the right solution to remove it permanently.

Herbal remedy for Diabete patients 
What is Diabetes?
Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat.
Let me explain.
When you eat, your body turns food into sugars, or glucose. At that point, your pancreas is supposed to release insulin. Insulin serves as a ‚Äúkey‚Äù to open your cells, to allow the glucose to enter and allow you to use the glucose for energy.
But with diabetes, this system does not work.
Below are home remedies and herbal treatments you can apply without any skill or professional knowledge to heal yourself or anyone suffering from diabetes.
1. ONIONS 
Onions are one of the top food sources for the trace mineral chromium, which has a powerful positive effect on blood glucose levels.
Instructions
One cup of raw onion (about ¬Ω cup cooked onion) gives you 24mcg of the ‚Äúadequate intake‚Äù recommendation of 25 ‚Äì 35mcg of chromium.
So eating lots of onion is a very powerful way of helping your body defeat diabetes.
2. BITTER MELON. 
This fruit contains several chemicals which helps to reduce blood sugar levels and also acts as an appetite stimulant, which can aid weight loss.
3. BITTER LEAVES, SCENT LEAVES AND PUMPKIN LEAVES. 
These leafs are very powerful at curing diabetes. You will need to get them in enough quantities.

Filter the mixture, allow to cool, & store in bottles.
Drink in the morning, evening & night.
It‚Äôs a good cure for diabetes and this herbal treatment is very effective in curing Diabetes.
4. GARLIC. 
Garlic contains a compound called allicin, which has also proven to modulate the diabetic condition. So eat as much as you can eat.
5. WHEAT BARLEY GRASS. 
The health benefits of wheat are many. Whole wheat is rich in vitamins B1, B2, and B3 along with zinc, iron, calcium, magnesium, folic acid, phosphorus and fibre.
The magnesium content in wheat is believed to be responsible for activating enzymes in the body that balance out insulin production and glucose levels. When the body fails to produce enough insulin to break down the sugar in the food you eat, high blood sugar and diabetes can develop. Eating a diet rich in wheat is very beneficial for diabetics.
6. ALOE VERA. 
Aloe Vera acts as a liver tonic which helps to regulate blood sugar levels through supporting liver function.
7. BITTER LEAF AND SCENT LEAF. 
You will need sufficient quantities of bitter leaf and scent leafs.
Instructions
This two leaves should be pounded inside mortal with pestle.
No water should be added only the two leaves.
The water that come from the leave after pounding should be strain with strainer and put in an air tight container.
Add a pinch of salt and take one cup in the morning, one cup in the afternoon and one cup in the night.
8. CABBAGE. 
Like many members of the cruciferous vegetables, cabbage can help modulate and regularize the blood sugar.
9. TURMERIC. 
When mixed with alma (the Indian gooseberry), turmeric has been proven to be an effective treatment for diabetes.
10. CINNAMON. 
Use of cinnamon bark has been shown in clinical studies to improve both blood sugar and cholesterol levels.
11. BEANS. 
A rich source of both dietary fibre and complex carbohydrates, beans also help stimulate insulin production.
12. CUCUMBER AND RADISH. 
Leaves from cucumber and radish plants are low in carbohydrates and high in fibre, both of which contribute to diabetic management.
13. GINGER. 
This 19 best herbal treatments for diabetes in Nigeria will not be complete if Ginger is not included. The compound gingerol in this pungent root helps the muscles take up glucose into their cells, thus lowering overall blood sugar levels.
14. IF YOU ARE OVERWEIGHT, LOSE WEIGHT 
Any diabetes patient who is overweight should endeavors to lose weight. You should also avoid sitting idle and exercise your body to balance the insulin in your blood stream.
15. AVOID CARBOHYDRATE. 
You should be taking whole grain food like wheat instead of starchy carbohydrates like white rice, doughnut, yam, etc. Fruit vegetables will also help your health.

Do you know that one of the best medicine for ulcer is UNRIPE PAWPAW THERAPY. It‚Äôs not just a medicine ,is a cure. Tested and trusted üëå
ULCER TREATMENT
Get unripe paw-paw wash it. It must be UNRIPE, not ripe
Do not peel it and do not remove the seeds. 
After washing the outside neatly, slice it without peeling it into small small pieces. The cutting should be small like sugar cubes.
Put all the small pieces of the raw pawpaw into any clean container.
Fill the container with water to stop at the same point the sliced pawpaw stopped. 
Leave the pawpaw in the water for four days. For example if u soak it on a Monday,  count Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday will be the fourth day. 
On the Fourth day, the water will be looking milkish. Seive it and throw away the pawpaw and the water becomes your cure for ulcer. 
DOSAGE: drink half a glass of the pawpaw water every morning, afternoon and evening. You will no longer feel those ulcer pains because it will heal the wounds inside that are causing the pain.
This morning, afternoon and evening drinking of the pawpaw water can continue for weeks and months depending on how severe the ulcer is. It is not relief. It is a cure.
Additional note: An ulcer is an internal wound usually in the stomach or intestines.
Common causes of ulcer are infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and long-term use of aspirin and certain other painkillers, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox, others). Stress and spicy foods do not cause peptic ulcers. However, they can make your symptoms worse.
Pls avoid taking strong pain killers without prescription. If you take time to read the side effects you will see that the drugs for pain relief cause ulcer or wounds in the body....

Hello to Everyone ü•∞
LET'S TALK ABOUT VIGINAL ODOURS AND ITS CURES 
As a Lady, you must know the type of odor coming out from your private part in order to check how healthy you are...taken the odor ignorantly may end up given you what you never asked for...And to my best of research, there are 5 different odors that any lady may have experienced one in her life...We have the 
üëâ FISHY ODOR
üëâ ROTTEN ODOR
üëâ METALLIC ODOR
üëâ MUSKY ODOR AND
üëâ YEASTY ODOR....
a lady is said to have FISHY ODOR when the private parts smells exactly like a fresh fish..and it is also accompanied by a white or grey discharges...
This problem is caused by a bacteria imbalance... Mostly the bacteria that causes this is called VAGINOSIS..
ROTTEN ODORS Is a very serious problem which may lead to a lost tampon...And this problem can creates lots of problems to you to the extent that,your private part will start to rot....In a normal case ,it is also caused by a bacteria but smarter than the fishy bacteria....
The METALLIC ODOR is when your private part smells like a rusted metal..and this normally happens after your monthly period or after the private part pH is being disrupted via ejaculation..Normally, it takes 3-7 days for this odor to go naturally, but if it persist,you need to check your health especially your private part pH....
when your private part gives a musky smell,it means you are wearing tight panties and therefore,you aren't given the organ any chance to take in air...And the more this happens,the more it allows bacteria to come closer to you via your private part....
The YEAST ODOR means you are having yeast infection.. So once it gives a YEASTY odor,Better check your health....
In all these,all you need to do is to WASH your private part very well...And that does not call for soap...most times your husband stays away because of the smell that comes out from your private part...
To cure all these problems , boil Neem leaves and clove together or only clove for 15 minutes add little salt when it cools little, sit inside it  or u use the water to wash your private part .
Or 
 just boil your water, add your sea salt to it then sit inside for about 15-20 minutes ...Especially during your periods and twice a week...this will help keep there healthy and also smell good....you need to be healthy from inside to glow outside.
