Go to your Jenkins-Ansible server and create a new directory called ansible-config-artifact â€“ we will store there all artifacts after each build.

sudo mkdir /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact

Change Dir Permissions

sudo chmod -R 0777 /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact

or 

sudo chmod -R 0777 /home

Push to github.

Now connect to remote host of jenkins-ansible server.

I did was not seeing the full folders and files i pushed.

So i went back to my project 12 config in jenkins

I changed the branch to main, since vscode pushed to main branch.

How do i know?

I went to github and saw that the main branch had the files i pushed and master was outdated.

To test i edited the README.md file on main branch and saved and lo and behold check project 12 in jenkins and a build was triggered successfully.

Now connect to remote host. Files were showing now.

I ran

ansible all -m ping

and it said ansible not installed.

So i went back to other vscode window to install ansible.

This happened because i lost my aws account and created EC2 instaces afresh.
