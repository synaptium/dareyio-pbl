Push to github.

Now connect to remote host of jenkins-ansible server.

I did was not seeing the full folders and files i pushed.

So i went back to my project 12 config in jenkins

I changed the branch to main, since vscode pushed to main branch.

How do i know?

I went to github and saw that the main branch had the files i pushed and master was outdated.

To test i edited the README.md file on main branch and saved and lo and behold check project 12 in jenkins and a build was triggered successfully.

Now connect to remote host. Files were showing now.

I ran

ansible all -m ping

and it said ansible not installed.

So i went back to other vscode window to install ansible.

This happened because i lost my aws account and created EC2 instaces afresh.

![alt text](./ansicbleconfig.png)

![alt text](./ass.png)

Connected to remote server and tried to run ansible all -m ping

Some of the server had the wrong private ip and user stated in the dev.yml file.

I saved and tried to connect to the remote server and got errors connection.

I had to open the ssh config file on my pc to see that the jenkins ansible server ip there is wrong.

I tried againa and same thing. So i checked aws and saw that the server had errors.

So i stopped it and started it. Errors now gone.

Tried to connect agai remotely and connected.

Ran the command ansible all -m ping

It piged al servers minus LB server.

Ignored it and did a cd to the ansible directory amd ran my playbook.

It worked.


![alt text](./succed.png)


Log into LB server.

Under ansible folder, in vscode create the following

![alt text](./tree.png)

Now login to the jenkins server via ssh and edit /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

![alt text](./edit.png)

Within the static-assignments folder, create a new assignment for uat-webservers uat-webservers.yml. This is where you will reference the role.

---
- hosts: uat-webservers
  roles:
     - webserver

![alt text](./uato.png)

Edit site.yml to the following

---
- hosts: all
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common.yml

- hosts: uat-webservers
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/uat-webservers.yml


![alt text](./site.png)

Edit main.yml under tasks folder

and paste in the following

---
- name: install apache
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.yum:
    name: "httpd"
    state: present

- name: install git
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.yum:
    name: "git"
    state: present

- name: clone a repo
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.git:

  become: true
  ansible.builtin.file:
    path: /var/www/html/html
    state: absent


Now do a push to github main branch.

Go to github and do a pull request.

make sure to select main branch as source.


![alt text](./pull.png)


On bash terminal on vscode do a git checkout main.

and do a git pull  so that the changes from main branch on github matches tha on our pc.

Run ansible playbook

sudo ansible-playbook -i /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact/inventory/uat.yml /home/u
buntu/ansible-config-artifact/playbooks/site.yml

I got an error.


![alt text](./project.png)

So i looked at the site.yml

![alt text](./kk.png)

Host is difeined as all

So it is calling all servers and i stopped the instances LB,DB,Webserver 1, Webserver 2, and NFS

si i went to Ec2 and started all the instance and got success.
